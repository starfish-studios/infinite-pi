# CHANGELOG
- ### Added Infinite Pie
   - **Infinite Pie** can be crafted using a Dragon Egg, Nether Star, Sugar, and Gold Ingot. It is very expensive, and this is intentional. There is only 1 Dragon Egg per world if you do not duplicate it, and thus, there is only 1 Infinite Pie. 
   - Infinite Pie can be eaten.. well, infinitely. When eaten, it does not get consumed like a traditional food item would. Instead, every time it is eaten, a single digit of Pi gets added to the item's lore, as well as a counter that counts how many times you've eaten it, which is subquently linked to the amount of digits in the Pi lore.
   - Infinite Pie can not be destroyed. Not by Lava, not by TNT, not by the void. If dropped into the void, it will just return to the inventory it came from.
   - Infinite Pie can, however, be dropped on the ground and picked up by other players. It can also be taken from Chests by other players. Will you wage war, or be kind and share?

That's pretty much it. Infinite Pie. Infinite food. We have cured world hunger. You're welcome. Happy Pi Day!

**DISCLAIMER :** _We are not adding any items to this mod other than Infinite Pie. Unless Infinite Pie gets more features, nothing else will be added to this mod. Long live Infinite Pie._
